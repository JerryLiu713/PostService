Build on the code in: https://spring.io/blog/2015/07/14/microservices-with-spring and add 1 project that do the following:

One is a service that manages posts. It supports:
Storing a post – includes the body of the post, a subject (optional), a post this one depends on (optional). “Storing” does mean storing into a database – H2 should be fine.
Operations to retrieve posts – you can decide which operations you need
Again, “retrieve” means to retrieve from the database
